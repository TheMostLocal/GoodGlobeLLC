   Accounting System

    https://github.com/ctSkennerton/UsTaxes?tab=readme-ov-file
            Tax System works and is equipped with great tools
            *initial thought* How can we make it unique and closed source?/only available to us-  Can we make client accounts to save previous info? Would like to keep all info and scan previous info to categorize uniquley by client

            ideas-could add this to app and give a category for businesses to file their own taxes..how can we make customer accounts to login from home?
